  Language modeling has witnessed remarkable advancements in
  recent years, with Large Language Models (LLMs) like
  ChatGPT setting unparalleled benchmarks in human-like text
  generation. However, a prevailing limitation is the
  underrepresentation of languages like Tamil in these
  cutting-edge models, leading to suboptimal performance in
  diverse linguistic contexts. This paper addresses this
  lacuna, enhancing the open-source LLaMA model with an
  addition of 16,000 Tamil tokens, aiming to achieve
  superior text generation and comprehension in the Tamil
  language. We strategically employ the LoRA methodology for
  efficient model training on a comprehensive Tamil corpus,
  ensuring computational feasibility and model robustness.
  Moreover, we introduce a Tamil-translated version of the
  Alpaca dataset and a subset of the OpenOrca dataset
  tailored for instruction fine-tuning. Our results showcase
  significant performance improvements in Tamil text
  generation, with potential implications for the broader
  landscape of LLMs in Indian languages. We further
  underscore our commitment to open research by making our
  models, datasets, and code publicly accessible, fostering
  further innovations in language modeling.
